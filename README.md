## 🚀 Project Overview

This portfolio is built to serve as a professional online presence where potential clients and employers can explore my work, read testimonials from past collaborators, and get in touch with me easily.

The website is carefully crafted with a combination of modern web technologies, clean design principles, and accessibility in mind.

## 🌈 Design & Features Highlights

### Transparent Glassmorphic Header  
- The header background uses a modern glass-like semi-transparent effect that adapts to light and dark modes, allowing subtle visibility of the content behind it.
- This design choice creates a sleek and modern user experience.

### Responsive & Accessible Layout  
- Fully responsive design tailored for desktops, tablets, and mobiles.
- Accessibility attributes (`aria-label`, keyboard navigation support) included for inclusive usability.

### Dynamic Multilingual Support  
- Users can switch seamlessly between four languages.
- All visible text, placeholders, error messages, and button labels dynamically update based on language selection.
- Translations are stored in separate JSON files for easy maintenance and scalability.

### Interactive Project Showcase  
- A dedicated section displays featured projects with descriptive titles, technology stacks, live previews, and GitHub repository links.
- Project images use lazy loading (`data-src`) for performance optimization.

### Client Testimonials Slider  
- Rotating testimonials with navigation arrows.
- Each testimonial includes client feedback, platform logos (custom SVG icons), and author names.
- Smooth animations enhance user engagement.

### Contact Section with Form Validation  
- A contact form with fields for name, email, subject, and message.
- Client-side validation ensures all required inputs are correctly filled.
- Google reCAPTCHA v2 integration prevents spam submissions.
- Backend PHP form handler processes submissions securely (excluded from public repository for privacy).
- Error handling popups inform users clearly when issues arise.

### SEO & Performance Optimizations  
- `robots.txt` carefully configured to disallow crawling of sensitive directories and file types.
- Sitemap XML provided for search engines.
- Next-gen image formats (`.webp`) used for faster loading times.
- Efficient CSS and JS loading order to minimize blocking.
